ListDosDevices V0.2.1 - lists for drive letters A: to Z: the DriveType and kernel name
Freeware by Uwe Sieber (c) 2008-2012


It's a console application. Since Windows NT drive letters are symbolic
links to kernel objects. Because they where invented for DOS compatibility
there also called 'DOS Device Names'. Other examples for DOS Device Names
are COM1, COM2, LPT1, Volume{433619ed-c6ea-11d9-a3b2-806d6172696f},
PhysicalDrive0, etc.
Their purpose is to make kernel objects accessible in the Win32 namespace.
Get SysInternals WinOBJ to see them in a GUI.
